this thing draws doctor eggman. real ones will know what I'm talking about (look up robotnik juggling on youtube).

yeah that's about it. it is animated using six different turtles that jump asynchronously.

it also includes some geometry stuff made just for this project and a custom turtle class.

you can change the constants table at the top of the `draw.py` file to suit your needs.
